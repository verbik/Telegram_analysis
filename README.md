It is said that an average Telegram user sends about 150 messages a day, multiply it by 365 and you get 54750 messages just from one person a year. But there are also people who responds to that messages, channels and groups. Downloading with a limit of 100000 messages from one chat I have 469530 in total from 2021. That is a huge amount of data that can give you various insights.


This project is aimed at exploratory data analysis of data collected from Telegram. Here I try to answer numerous questions I can make up about this data. Here I use python and its packages like pandas, matplotlib and numpy.
